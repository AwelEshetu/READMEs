# READMEs

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone/READMEs](https://badges.gitter.im/codingforeveryone/READMEs.svg)](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone/READMEs?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This is a place for creating and using tutorials. The idea is to create a short tutorial on a topic of your choice as a way to consolidate your own learning and to help others. 

We recommend that you create a pull request for your tutorial and put a request on Gitter for it to be reviewed and merged into the *master* branch.

## Checklist for creating READMEs

+ Pick your topic; keep it small;
+ Google for tutorials on your chosen topic;
+ Skim the tutorials you find and pick your favourite;
+ If you don't think you can improve on your favourite tutorial then just summarise it in a single paragraph and link to it;
+ If you think it could be simplified or made easier to understand, then give it a go;
+ If you think the topic can be clarified with a Code Wars kata, then create one and link to it;
+ Add an introductory paragraph that describes the *What, Why, How* of the topic;
+ Add a *Related* section and list any related topics that you think we need READMEs for;
+ Link the related topics to any READMEs that already exist;
+ Add a *References* section and link to any material that you found useful in your research;
+ Add a nice illustrative diagram or screenshot;
+ Add your README to this repo and give it a sensible name; *
+ Above all, keep your explanations short and simple;
+ **Bonus**: If you are feeling adventurous, create a screencast to accompany your README.

(* Sensible names are all lower-case, do not have spaces or non-ASCII characters and end with the .md file extension)
