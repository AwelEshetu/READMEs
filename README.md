# READMEs

##Introduction
This is a place for creating, editing and using tutorials (READMEs). The idea is to help build a collection of tutorials as a way to consolidate your own learning and to help others. There are two ways to contribute:

1. Add a new tutorial.
2. Improve the existing tutorials.

But first you need to understand a bit about GitHub!

##Using GitHub

GitHub can be confusing at first. You need to understand at least the meaning of the terms *branch*, *master*, and *pull request* before you will be able to contribute. Check out the README on the [Contributor workflow](#tobeadded) for more information.

Note that the existing READMEs are available at two locations, the [repository](https://github.com/codingforeveryone/READMEs) from where you can edit them and add new ones, and the [GitBook](http://codingforeveryone.foundersandcoders.org/index.html) which represents the files in a more convenient form for browsing. Cross-references within READMEs should point to the files in the GitBook, not the repository.

GitHub READMEs are written using a markup language called Markdown. You can familiarise yourself with Markdown using the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](http://codingforeveryone.foundersandcoders.org/programmer-skills/markdown-cheat-sheet.html).

## Adding a new tutorial

### General guidelines
Make sure the topic is not already covered, keep the topic small, and aim to be simple and brief. Do not feel you need to write at length if an external resource has done it well: just summarise and link to it. In any case, your README should contain at least:

1. An **Introduction** providing a single paragraph on the what, why and how of the topic.
2. A penultimate section called **Related**, listing related topics and linking to existing READMEs in the GitBook where appropriate. If a related topic is not covered, consider raising it as an issue or mentioning it on Gitter.
3. A final section called **References**, linking to other helpful resources on the topic.

Some further notes:

4. If you think the topic can be clarified with a Code Wars kata, then create one and link to it.
5. Consider adding a nice illustrative diagram or screenshot.
6. **Bonus**: If you are feeling adventurous, create a screencast to accompany your README.

###Submitting a pull request

Before you submit a pull request for a new README, please make sure you have created it in the appropriate folder and added a link to it in SUMMARY.md. Submit the new file and revised SUMMARY.md as part of a single pull request. If you are unsure how to do this, consult the [Contributor workflow](#tobeadded) README.
