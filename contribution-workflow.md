# Contribution Workflow

## Introduction

This document outlines the workflow and steps to go through when proposing new changes to the README repository. This counts for improvements of current READMEs as well as for adding new READMEs.
At first sight the process might seem complicated but it is a great practice for contribution to future programming projects and
ensures that all added changes are checked.

## The Feature Branch Workflow

For contribution we are using a process called [Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).
The basic concept of this workflow is that every change is treated as a new "feature" and made on dedicated branch for that change.

Once the change is ready a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) will be raised. This pull request will be checked by another person and then merged into the master branch.
After the merge the branch for that change has to be deleted, since it is not needed anymore.

In the next chapter we will go through the necessary steps and how to execute them through the console in more detail.

## Specific steps to go through for each change

1. Branch creation
2. Stage & commit changes
3. Push changes
4. Create pull request
5. Review & merging of changes
