# Contribution Workflow

## Introduction

This document outlines the workflow and steps to go through when proposing new changes to the README repository. Those steps are necessary for improvements of current READMEs as well as for adding new READMEs.
At first sight the process might seem complicated but it is a great exercise for contribution to future programming projects and
ensures that all added changes are checked.

## The Feature Branch Workflow

For contribution we are using a process called [Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).
The basic concept of this workflow is that every change is treated as a new "feature" and made on dedicated branch for that change.

The following picture visualizes this process of creating and merging a new branch for each feature / change:

Once the change is ready a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) will be raised. This pull request will be checked by another person and then merged into the master branch.
After the merge the branch for that change has to be deleted, since it is not needed anymore.

In the next chapter we will go through the necessary steps and how to execute them through the console in more detail.

## Specific steps to go through for each change

There are 4 main steps to go through for a new change to be implemented. The first 3 steps are done by the person who proposes the change, while the

1. Create a new branch
2. Stage, commit & push changes to the branch
4. Create and assign a pull request
5. Review & merge the changes
