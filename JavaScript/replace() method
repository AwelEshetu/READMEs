# ** `replace() method` **

## **Sometimes in javascript we may want to replace all or part of a string with something else.**

**We can do this with the replace() method, that searches a string for a specified value, or a regular expression, and returns a new string where the specified values are replaced.**

For example 
```
    var greeting = "Hello, do you like yellow?";
    var myString = greeting.replace("yellow", "red"); // yellow is the word to be replaced //

    The result of greeting would be "Hello, do you like red?";
```
This can be really useful if for instance you have a lot of text and want to replace certain words with others.
