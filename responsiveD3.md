If you're building a visualisation with D3, many of your audience will be coming from mobile devices. 

Over in my <a href="https://github.com/radiocontrolled/responsiveD3Tutorial">responsiveD3Tutorial</a> repo, I've created a tutorial 
that will walk you though how to make a D3 visualisation that is responsive, by way of listning for a resize event in the window. 

Any and all feedback welcome!

Thanks 
Alison
