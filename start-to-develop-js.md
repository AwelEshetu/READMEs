# Start to develop JavaScript

## A little bit of history

JavaScript, also known as ECMAScript is programming language created by
[Brendam Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) for the
Netscape browser in 1995. JavaScript was created to give some dynamism
to the static web pages of that dates. Now, the most important websites
of internet are huge JavaScript applications. Some of them are Gmail,
Youtube, Netflix, Airbnb...

There are two mainly environments where JavaScript can be executed, browsers
like Internet Explorer, Chrome or Firefox and [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org),
which let you execute javascript in the command line or like a server language
in substitution of *php*, *java*, *ruby*, or others.

## Code Editors and IDEs
In order to start coding, we will need a tool for write our code which
can help us to be more productive writing code, avoid mistakes, highlighting
our code and exposing our syntax errors.

In this README I'm going to talk about two main kinds of code editors:
- Online Code Editors
- Desktop Code Editors

### Online Code Editors

Sometimes, it's heavy to setup your environment to start develop some
small things, or concept proofs. Or may be you only want to be able to
share a small snippet with other people. To accomplish those things we
have available some online code editors like [jsbin](https://jsbin.com),
[jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [codepen](http://codepen.io/).
There you can write your code a run it without leave the browser.
There are too others tools with more features like
[cloud9](https://c9.io/), which allows you to run codre from other
languages, or even run a web server in nodejs.


#### How to start with jsbin
- Open a browser and go to [http://jsbin.com](http://jsbin.com)
- Choose the language you are going to code with
- Write your code
- Check your syntax errors
- Fix your code
- Run you code
- And share it

### Desktop Code Editors

One of the first things you are gonna need is a code editor. A code
editor is a tool like *the notepad* which allows you to write code, but
it comes with some tools like code highlighting, autocompletion or small
snippets to avoid repeat some tasks.

Let's gonna see some of them:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This is a free
  an open source code editor from MicroSoft. It has a lot of packages
  and plugins.
- [Atom](https://atom.io/). It's a free and open source code editor
  developed by GitHub.
  It has a lot of packages and plugins for everything you can need.
- [Brackets](http://brackets.io/). Another free and open source code
  editor developed by Adobe. It comes with Live Preview, which is a good
  feature for newbies, it allows you preview every change you made on
  your code files in the browser.
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). One of the most famous
  code editor. It has a bunch of packages and plugins. It isn't free,
  but you can download a trial version which is completly functional.

## Code Linters

There are some tool for checking your code looking for syntax error
and bad practices. The two most popular are:

- [jslint](http://www.jslint.com/)
- [jshint](http://jshint.com/)

Both of them have online tools for check your code, but there are
plugins for almost every code editor, and also for the command line.
