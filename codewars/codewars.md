# Codewars

## Introduction

Codewars is a great way to learn (and teach) code! The Codewars platform is quite carefully developed and designed, and usually functions well, although it does have some limitations. The following guide contains some of the information that you will find useful to know about the Codewars platform. Note that not all of this information is available on the Codewars website and some of it is a little subjective.

## Code Challenges or Kata

The Codewars platform offers code challenges which are called kata and can be solved using different programming languages. Users can get involved with the kata in a number of ways: they can solve, create, comment on or review any of the kata based on a set of rules, as discussed below.

## Kata Ranking

Every kata is assigned a 'kyu' rank, based on its difficulty. The kyu rank number decreases with increasing kata difficulty, such that the easiest kata are ranked 8 kyu and the hardest are 1 kyu. The ranks so far implemented are:
- 8 and 7 kyu (beginner, white belt colour)
- 6 and 5 kyu (novice, yellow belt colour)
- 4 and 3 kyu (competent, blue belt colour)
- 2 and 1 kyu (proficient, purple belt colour)

The ranking is determined by the community, and is somewhat controversial. What is difficult for some users may be easy for others, and 'difficulty' can be understood in different ways (amount of work needed to solve the problem, the complexity of the algorithm involved, etc.)

The ranking is also said to reflect the kata subject area. However, this is rarely considered when ranking a kata (e.g. regular expressions are only supposed to appear in kata of 4 kyu or higher, and yet there are plenty of 8 kyu regex kata).

You may find that some older kata, created in the early days of Codewars, are higher-rated than similar newer kata.

## Solving a Kata

The website will suggest a kata for you to solve next, based on your chosen 'focus' (whether you want to warm up with the fundamentals, practice at your current level or rank up). However, you can also search for kata (through the 'Kata' section on the left navigation bar) based on their difficulty and subject area - all kata are labelled with one or several tags indicating the latter.

Once you've selected a kata, you will see the instructions panel, a panel to write your solution in, and a panel for the test cases. Use 'Run Tests' to test your initial solution, and 'Submit' for more thorough testing of a solution that has passed the initial tests. Finally, you may refactor or comment on your solution before hitting 'Submit Final' to send off your final solution.

## Kata Discussion Page

Once you've solved a kata, you get full access to its discussion page (including the content marked as 'spoiler'), as well as to everyone else's solutions to that kata.

The discussion page allows you to let others know of any comments you may have, ask questions, mark issues or even just thank the user for their kata. It is possible to mark your comment as 'Question', 'Suggestion' or 'Issue'.

You can use markdown in your comments, the same way as in GitHub. This is particularly useful when pasting code into your comment. Make sure to mark your comment as spoiler if it contains information about the kata that might give out clues about the solution.

Solutions can be upvoted as either 'Best Practice', indicating a good balance of performance, readability and maintainability, or as 'Clever', which indicates creative coding styles and features that would not necessarily be used in production.

Similar solutions are grouped together, however, the algorithm behind this is rather poor so identical solutions often appear as separate. (The solutions need to be more or less exactly the same, except for whitespaces.)

## The Beta Process

After a beta kata is created, it goes through a community approval process, to ensure that it is of sufficient quality and that all issues have been resolved.

When you solve a beta kata, you will be able to estimate its difficulty rank (provided you have at least 50 honour, see below) and to mark it as ready. Alternatively, you may report any minor or major issues with the kata that you noticed.

Note that marking a beta kata as ready is equivalent to upvoting an official kata.

In order for a beta kata to be published as an official kata, it needs:
- 5 approval votes (i.e. be marked as ready 5 times)
- a sufficient number of difficulty ranks to achieve a consensus
- an approval from a moderator or a user with at least 3000 honour (see below)

Most of the issues reported for the kata need to be resolved before it is published as an official kata. If any issue is kept unresolved, the number of approval votes needed for the kata to be published increases.

When raising an issue, it is useful to mention what translation of the kata you are referring to.

## Authoring a Kata

Please refer to the following two guides for information on how to author a kata: [Writing Your Own Kata](http://codingforeveryone.foundersandcoders.org/codewars/writing-your-own-kata.html) and [Random Test Cases for Complete Beginners](http://codingforeveryone.foundersandcoders.org/codewars/random-test-cases-for-complete-beginners.html).

## User Ranking

You are given a rank as a user, which advances based on the difficulty of the kata you complete. You need to complete 10 kata of the next rank to advance to that rank. Completing kata of higher or lower rank will reduce or increase, respectively, the number of kata you will have to complete to advance.

Advancing to a higher rank also earns you honour (see below).

## The Honour System

You earn honour each time you complete a kata. The amount you earn depends on the belt colour of the kata:
- white: +1 honour
- yellow: +2 honour
- blue: +5 honour
- purple: +10 honour

Solving a beta kata earns you an additional +2 honour per kata. Attempting a kata and not solving it will not affect your honour.

Likewise, you earn honour each time you author a kata. The honour is awarded when the kata is published as an official kata. Each kata earns you +3 honour, and additional honour depending on the belt colour determined by the community (not the one assigned by yourself):
- white: +2 honour
- yellow: +4 honour
- blue: +10 honour
- purple: +40 honour

Ranking up earns you honour depending on the rank achieved:
- 7 kyu: +15 honour
- 6 kyu: +20 honour
- 5 kyu: +25 honour
- 4 kyu: +30 honour
- 3 kyu: +50 honour
- 2 kyu: +75 honour
- 1 kyu: +100 honour

Additional honour can be obtained in the following ways:
- by other people marking your beta kata as 'ready', or upvoting your published kata (+1 per upvote)
- by other people upvoting your comments or marking your solutions as 'best practice' or 'clever' (+1 per upvote)
- by people signing up to Codewars through your referrals link

Downvotes of your comments will decrease your honour (-1 per downvote).

Unfortunately, the honour system can be a bit buggy, and will not always immediately give you the right amount of honour. You will usually get the honour you are missing when the system refreshes, e.g. next time you solve a kata. 

Another limitation of Codewars is that there are no notifications for honour earned, and the honour history is not logged, which may sometimes leave you feel confused about why you have earned (or even lost) a certain amount of honour.

## Allies and Clans

You can choose to follow other users, which will add them to the 'allies' list on your home page, and allow you to keep track of their activity. You can also join a 'clan', which will automatically add all other members of the clan to your allies list. If you would like to join the 'Founders & Coders' clan, just spell it out as it appears here, using the ampersand symbol rather than the word 'and'.

## Leaderboard

The top 500 users (based on honour, rather than kyu ranking) appear on the leaderboard. Currently you need about 800 honour to get on it.

## Privileges

The honour also determines the 'privileges' that you get as a user.

- 25 honour: Ability to author a kata
- 50 honour: Ability to vote on beta kata
- 75 honour: Ability to mark comments as having spoiler code
- 100 honour: Ability to estimate the ranking of beta kata
- 200 honour: Ability to mark major issues on beta kata
- 350 honour: Ability to moderate comments marked as having spoilers
- 500 honour: Kata voting power increases to +2 honour per upvote
- 1000 honour: Kata voting power increases to +3 honour per upvote
- 1500 honour: Ability to contribute to kata
- 2000 honour: Kata voting power increases to +4 honour per upvote
- 3000 honour: Ability to approve a kata

## Tips for developing your skills

- Train every day.
- Don't skip kata that contain unfamiliar methods/tasks. Embrace the challenge, use your resources to study the methodologies needed.
- After completing a kata, consider searching for a similar kata for added practice benefits of the skills you've just used.
- When building a solution, you should consider using your browser's developer tools, or a good online console as your environment of choice, which will help break down a solution and resolve issues with it too. For more information on available online console options, visit [here](http://codingforeveryone.foundersandcoders.org/programmer-skills/online-console-options.html). Visit [here](http://codingforeveryone.foundersandcoders.org/programmer-skills/Debugging-Javascript.html) for more information on how to utilize debugging to fix issues with your solution.
- Study impressive solutions to kata, particularly if they're scored highly for 'Best Practice' or 'Clever'. If you want to better understand a solution, ask the author for clarification, or load their solution into your environment of choice and break it down step by step.
- Be friendly when communicating with other users on Codewars, especially if you're reporting an issue with someone's kata. Help others and they'll help you in return.
- Follow users. If you notice a user creates a particularly impressive solution to a kata you've completed, follow them, complete the kata they've completed and study their solutions. Similarly, if a user has created an interesting or unique kata, follow them to keep up to date with their future kata.
- Plan a training session. Consider starting with a 7/8 kyu kata to warm up the brain cells as these are easier than the tougher kata (from level 6 kyu onwards). Starting with a tough kata could fatigue the mind too quickly and exhaust you for the rest of the day.
- When learning a new programming language, return to old completed kata and (if a kata translation for that language exists), complete it again with your new language. You may find problem solving in one language is much harder than in another, and vice versa, so use this approach to help understand the strengths and weaknesses of your new language.
- Use pseudo code to first write out a rough solution to a kata in steps. Read over the steps to consider whether they'd satisfy all cases for the solution, then build the solution. Leave your pseudo code in the final solution for others to understand, neaten it up grammatically too. Remember to also refactor your solution before you submit it as the final solution, by indenting your code well and naming arguments/variables/functions appropriately. If every user explained their solution well, it'd be much quicker to learn from the best solutions.
