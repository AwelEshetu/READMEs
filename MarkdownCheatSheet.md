This is a simple tutorial  to provide an introduction to Markdown and a reference to the most frequently used sintax.  
Here there is a short [interactive markdown tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com/) to try.   
Additionally this is a link to [John Gruber site](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), the creator of markdown, for a more exaustive list of the sintax.  

Below you can find a small cheatsheet with some sintax present in the interactive tutorial for quick reference.
