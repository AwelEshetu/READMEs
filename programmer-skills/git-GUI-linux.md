# Git GUI for Linux

### Choosing a GUI
The Github Desktop GUI is not available on Linux so you will need to pick another GUI to install. There are a variety of GUI's you can install which can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/linux).

### GitKraken
I would recommend the GitKraken GUI which can be downloaded [from the offical page](https://www.gitkraken.com/). It can be run on Windows, Mac and Linux desktop systems.
