#Planning With Pseudocode

This tutorial is aimed to help you implement your coding solutions without actually coding. How you might be wondering… through “Pseudocode”.

### Well wait, what is “Pseudocode”?

Pseudocode just means you’re writing a solution to a problem in English.
Sounds simple right? That’s because it is :)

Provide an example here…

### Not as complicated as you may think

Even though programming languages may seem a bit complicated at first, the logic that comes with a programming language is similar to other languages.

Whether you’re using Ruby, Python, JavaScript, etc., you’ll still be using conditional statements, functions, variables, loops, and other forms of common logical arrangements.

The only difference, the syntax.

### Why Pseudocode’s useful

It helps you establish the foundation of the code you’re about to write. Even better, with using Pseudocode, you’re free to express your thought process in your own words, thus doing away with conventional programming syntax. After recognizing the logic that comes with the code/program you’re about to write, all that’s left is replacing your pseudocode with the programming language syntax of your choice.
